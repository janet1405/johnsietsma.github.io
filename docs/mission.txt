Customer is someone running a project who is struggling to find someone with the skills needed to listen closely and fix their problems.

They're not after acronyms or years of this or that technology. They want to trust someone, to know that it will be done.

They will have a budget, but concentrate more on the value then the cost.

Often they wouldn't be sure where to search to find someone who can help them.

The projects will have createive, business, technical and social aspects.
